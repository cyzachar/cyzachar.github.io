					<h3 onclick = "showDescrip(this)">Java (JGrasp &amp; Eclipse)  &#9662; </h3>		<!--up triangle entity :  &#9652;-->
					<p>
						I took two courses in Java (using the Eclipse environment) at my high school and passed the AP Computer Science test with a 5.
						I've taken two more courses in Java (using JGrasp) at RIT, and I work as a teaching assistant for the first of these two.
						I'm accustomed to using the Java APIs to figure out classes that I am not familiar with and am comfortable explaining object oriented programming concepts or my ideas when it comes to solving problems using Java.
						Recently, I have been completing some challenges at <a class = "outsideInfo" href = "https://www.codeeval.com/profile/cyzachar/">CodeEval</a> to give myself more experience using Java to solve different types of problems.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "skills">
					<h3 onclick = "showDescrip(this)">HTML5 &amp; CSS3 &#9662;</h3>
					<p>
						I used webs.com to create my first website in high school but that was without the use of HTML and CSS and was a test of patience more than anything else.
						During my senior year, I taught myself HTML and CSS as an independent study, took a web class that used Dreamweaver, and volunteered to help with my school district's new website.
						Since then I've taken three web courses at RIT and have built nurmerous websites that reinforced my knowledge of these languages.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "skills">
					<h3 onclick = "showDescrip(this)">JavaScript  &#9662;</h3>
					<p>
						I completed the JavaScript Codecademy course in high school but didn't use JavaScript until my web classes at RIT.
						I'm confident in my knowledge of the language and have experience using it for animation, dynamic element creation, sorting and filtering, compatibility, and local storage.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "skills">
					<h3 onclick = "showDescrip(this)">jQuery  &#9662;</h3>
					<p>
						One of the projects for my client programming course focused on using jQuery (incorporating multiple plugins), rather than JavaScript alone, to handle webpage behavior.
						In addition, I used jQuery to continuously update and manage the interactive elements of a website I created during my internship at UPMC to display patient requests.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "skills">
					<h3 onclick = "showDescrip(this)">Node.js  &#9662;</h3>
					<p>
						I used Node.js to write skills for Amazon's Alexa Voice Service as part of my software engineering internship with UPMC.
						I'm fairly comfortable with the framework but feel as if I could use some more experience with it.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "skills">
					<h3 onclick = "showDescrip(this)">Alexa Voice Service Skills  &#9662;</h3>
					<p>
						This was the focus of the projects that I worked on over the course of my internship with UPMC Enterprises.
						I know what goes into the creation of a new Alexa skill and how to deploy and test it using AWS Lambda and Amazon's Alexa Skills Kit.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "skills">
					<h3 onclick = "showDescrip(this)">Jasmine Testing Framework  &#9662;</h3>
					<p>
						I have a fairly basic knowledge of the Jasmine JavaScript testing framework from my internship at UPMC and an interest in learning more.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "skills">
					<h3 onclick = "showDescrip(this)">PHP &#9662;</h3>
					<p>
						I have limited knowledge of PHP and have used it primarily to write to and retrieve data from a database.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "skills">
					<h3 onclick = "showDescrip(this)">Databases...SQL (MySQL)  &#9662;</h3>
					<p>
						I have some experience pulling data from and adding data to a MySQL database using PHP from one of my web courses and from a project I worked on as a software engineering intern for UPMC.
						Thanks to a database class, I know the process that goes into designing and implementing a database and how to draw and interpret E-R diagrams.
						I know the basic SQL commands and can use that knowledge to create and update tables and select and perform functions on data.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "skills">
					<h3 onclick = "showDescrip(this)">C# &amp; Visual Studio  &#9662;</h3>
					<p>
						For a client-side programming class project, I used C# to consume json data from a web service and display it on a windows form.
						I feel as if I know my way around the Visual Studio interface and had no difficulty picking up C# because of its similarity to Java (object-oriented).
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "skills">
					<h3 onclick = "showDescrip(this)">Git  &#9662;</h3>
					<p>
						I wrote Git commands on the Mac Terminal to access and maintain a repository on GitLab for my work for my summer internship at UPMC.
						I'm using Git Bash to push changes to this website.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "skills">
					<h3 onclick = "showDescrip(this)">Adobe Photoshop  &#9662;</h3>
					<p>
						I used Photoshop quite a bit in a junior high multimedia class and learned some new features in a Web I course at RIT.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "skills">
					<h3 onclick = "showDescrip(this)">Wireframing &amp; Prototyping  &#9662;</h3>
					<p>
						I've used Balsamiq and InVision (though not extensively) for wireframing and prototyping respectively for a UX Design course at RIT.
						While I may not know everything there is to know about these tools, I feel comfortable using them and am confident that I can figure out anything I don't know.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "skills">
					<h3 onclick = "showDescrip(this)">Visual Basic  &#9662;</h3>
					<p>
						This was my first programming language.
						I learned it during my freshman year of high school and haven't used it since, but should be able to pick it up again quickly if need be.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "skills">
					<h3 onclick = "showDescrip(this)">Minitab Statistical Software  &#9662;</h3>
					<p>
						I'm not so sure that I will find myself using this software in the future, but if it does come up, I know how to perform hypothesis testing on data with different characteristics using Minitab
						 and am familiar with many of the functionalities that the program offers (thanks to my second Statistics course).
					</p>
				</div>

				<!--Future Skills-->

				<div id = "futureSkills">
					<h3>"Skills in Progress"</h3>
					<p>
						These are skills that I expect to pick up over the course of the current semester, based on class descriptions and syllabi.

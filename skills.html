					<h3 id = "java" onclick = "showDescrip('java', 0)">Java (JGrasp &amp; Eclipse)  &#9662; </h3>		<!--up triangle entity :  &#9652;-->
					<p class = "descrip">
						I took two courses in Java (using the Eclipse environment) at my high school and passed the AP Computer Science test with a 5.
						I've taken two more courses in Java (using JGrasp) at RIT, and I now work as a teaching assistant for the first of these two.
						I'm accustomed to using the Java APIs to figure out classes that I am not familiar with and am comfortable explaining programming concepts or my ideas when it comes to solving problems using Java.
						Recently, I have been completing some challenges at <a class = "outsideInfo" href = "https://www.codeeval.com/profile/cyzachar/">CodeEval</a> to give myself more experience using Java to solve different types of problems.

				<div class = "skills">
					<h3 id = "html" onclick = "showDescrip('html', 1)">HTML5 &amp; CSS3 &#9662;</h3>
					<p class = "descrip">
						I used webs.com to create my first website in high school but that was without the use of HTML and CSS and was a test of patience more than anything else.
						During my senior year, I taught myself HTML and CSS as an independent study, took a web class that used Dreamweaver, and volunteered to help with my school district's new website.
						Since then I've taken two web design courses at RIT that reinforced my knowledge of these languages.
					</p>
				</div>	
				<div class = "skills">	
					<h3 id = "js" onclick = "showDescrip('js', 2)">JavaScript  &#9662;</h3> 
					<p class = "descrip">
						I completed the JavaScript Codecademy course in high school but didn't use it until my web classes at RIT.
						I haven't done anything particularly complex with it but expect to use it more in the near future.
					</p>
				</div>	
				<div class = "skills">	
					<h3 id = "php" onclick = "showDescrip('php', 3)">PHP &amp; MySQL  &#9662;</h3>
					<p class = "descrip">
						I have limited knowledge of PHP and MySQL from my Web II class but will be learning more in future classes.
					</p>
				</div>	
				<div class = "skills">	
					<h3 id = "adobePs" onclick = "showDescrip('adobePs', 4)">Adobe Photoshop  &#9662;</h3>
					<p class = "descrip">
						I used Photoshop quite a bit in a junior high multimedia class and learned some new features in a Web I course at RIT.
					</p>
				</div>	
				<div class = "skills">	
					<h3 id = "wire" onclick = "showDescrip('wire', 5)">Wireframing &amp; Prototyping  &#9662;</h3>
					<p class = "descrip">
						I've used Balsamiq and InVision (though not extensively) for wireframing and prototyping respectively for a UX Design course at RIT.
						While I may not know everything there is to know about these tools, I feel comfortable using them and am confident that I can figure out anything I don't know.
						I have more experience with Balsamiq because I've been using it to design an app outside of class.
					</p>
				</div>	
				<div class = "skills">	
					<h3 id = "VB" onclick = "showDescrip('VB', 6)">Visual Basic  &#9662;</h3>
					<p class = "descrip">
						This was my first programming language.
						I learned it during my freshman year of high school and haven't used it since, but should be able to pick it up again quickly if need be.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id = "futureSkills">

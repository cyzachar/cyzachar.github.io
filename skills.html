					<h3 onclick = "showDescrip(this)">Java (JGrasp &amp; Eclipse)  &#9662; </h3>		<!--up triangle entity :  &#9652;-->
					<p>
						I took two courses in Java (using the Eclipse environment) at my high school and passed the AP Computer Science test with a 5.
						I've taken two more courses in Java (using JGrasp) at RIT, and I work as a teaching assistant for the first of these two.
						I'm accustomed to using the Java APIs to figure out classes that I am not familiar with and am comfortable explaining object oriented programming concepts or my ideas when it comes to solving problems using Java.
						Recently, I have been completing some challenges at <a class = "outsideInfo" href = "https://www.codeeval.com/profile/cyzachar/">CodeEval</a> to give myself more experience using Java to solve different types of problems.
					</p>

					<h3 onclick = "showDescrip(this)">HTML5 &amp; CSS3 &#9662;</h3>
					<p>
						I used webs.com to create my first website in high school but that was without the use of HTML and CSS and was a test of patience more than anything else.
						During my senior year, I taught myself HTML and CSS as an independent study, took a web class that used Dreamweaver, and volunteered to help with my school district's new website.
						Since then I've taken three web courses at RIT that reinforced my knowledge of these languages.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "skills">
					<h3 onclick = "showDescrip(this)">JavaScript  &#9662;</h3>
					<p>
						I completed the JavaScript Codecademy course in high school but didn't use JavaScript until my web classes at RIT.
						I have a good working knowledge of the language and have experience using it for animation, dynamic element creation, browser compatibility, and local storage.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "skills">
					<h3 onclick = "showDescrip(this)">JQuery  &#9662;</h3>
					<p>
						One of the projects for my client programming course focused on using JQuery (incorporating multiple plugins), rather than JavaScript alone, to handle webpage behavior.
						I may have to review syntax a bit but I feel comfortable using it.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "skills">
					<h3 onclick = "showDescrip(this)">PHP &#9662;</h3>
					<p>
						I have limited knowledge of PHP from my Web II class but expect to use it more in the future.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "skills">
					<h3 onclick = "showDescrip(this)">Databases...SQL (MySQL)  &#9662;</h3>
					<p>
						I have some experience pulling data from and adding data to a MySQL database using PHP from one of my web courses.
						Thanks to a database class, I know the process that goes into designing and implementing a database and how to draw and interpret E-R diagrams.
						I know the basic SQL commands and can use that knowledge to create and update tables and select and perform functions on data.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "skills">
					<h3 onclick = "showDescrip(this)">C# &amp; Visual Studio  &#9662;</h3>
					<p>
						For a client-side programming class project, I used C# to consume json data from a web service and display it on a windows form.
						I feel as if I know my way around the Visual Studio interface and had no difficulty picking up C# because of its similarity to Java (object-oriented).
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "skills">
					<h3 onclick = "showDescrip(this)">Adobe Photoshop  &#9662;</h3>
					<p>
						I used Photoshop quite a bit in a junior high multimedia class and learned some new features in a Web I course at RIT.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "skills">
					<h3 onclick = "showDescrip(this)">Wireframing &amp; Prototyping  &#9662;</h3>
					<p>
						I've used Balsamiq and InVision (though not extensively) for wireframing and prototyping respectively for a UX Design course at RIT.
						While I may not know everything there is to know about these tools, I feel comfortable using them and am confident that I can figure out anything I don't know.
						I have more experience with Balsamiq because I've been using it to design an app outside of class.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "skills">
					<h3 onclick = "showDescrip(this)">Visual Basic  &#9662;</h3>
					<p>
						This was my first programming language.
						I learned it during my freshman year of high school and haven't used it since, but should be able to pick it up again quickly if need be.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "skills">
					<h3 onclick = "showDescrip(this)">Minitab Statistical Software  &#9662;</h3>
					<p>
						I'm not so sure that I will find myself using this software in the future, but if it does come up, I know how to perform hypothesis testing on data with different characteristics using Minitab
						 and am familiar with many of the functionalities that the program offers (thanks to my second Statistics course).

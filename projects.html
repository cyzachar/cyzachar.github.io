					<h3>Franklin Regional High School Website</h3>
					<p>
						At the beginning of my senior year of high school, I learned that my school district was re-doing its website.
						  I volunteered to help, and, being the only contributer who knew HTML and CSS, I was tasked with fixing formatting errors by directly editing the code generated by the site-building program.
						  I worked on two main pages (as well as their subpages): the High School Clubs and Activities page and the Elementary School Links.
						  Throughout this experience, I communicated with club sponsors and representatives to get descriptions of clubs online and with a computing teacher at one of the elementary schools to
						  correct broken links and figure out how to arrange and display links to make specific ones easy to find for the kids.
					</p>
					<p>
						Both of these sets of pages have been edited since I worked on them (the links pages in particular are not formatted consistently anymore) and are not noteworthy in appearance as I didn't have much freedom with styling.
						  For these reasons, I have not included a screenshot or a link.

					<h3>Web I Psychology of Design Website</h3>
					<p>
						The final project for my Web I class was to create a website on a topic of our choice.
						I chose the psychology of design and pulled the color scheme for the website from an image of a peacock feather (which is also the site's favicon).
					</p>
					<p>
						A description of some of the features of the website may be found on the resources page.
						The most interesting of these features may be found at the bottom of the color page where I used an image map and Javascript to display different information based on the user's choice.

					<h3>Web II Mackinac Island Website</h3>
					<p>
						I worked on this website for both the midterm and final projects for my Web II class.
						Inspiration for the color scheme came from the Victorian trim on the mostly white houses of downtown Mackinac, and features of note are the DHTML on the natural attractions page and the responsive design of the website.
						The blog (built with PHP) does not work correctly on this server because it isn't set up to access the database that is located on a different server.

					<h3>Java Trouble Game</h3>
					<p>
						This started out as a group project until my partner dropped the class early on.
						As a result, I ended up completing it on my own.
					</p>
					<p>
						The final product is a multi-player game that is based off of the board game Trouble and is played on one device.
						My version is similar to the original in the determination of the beginning player, the operation of turns, and the general rules of the game.
						The only differences are in board size and the number of pieces that players move from start to finish.
					</p>
					<p>
						The most difficult aspects of implementation were the tie-breaker scenario during the determination of the starting player, the logic behind turn-taking and move validation, and the handling of all the possible cases that could occur as a player's piece nears and enters the finish spaces.

					<h3>Java Mancala Game</h3>
					<p>
						I worked in a group of four to create a networked game based off of Mancala as my final project for my second Java course at RIT.
						We worked well together, and the finished game both looks good and functions as it should, with the exception of a few self-correcting bugs that likely result from a problem with the sending or receiving of data between client and server.
						The primary challenge in the creation of this game was the interaction between the server and the client -- more specifically, the receipt and processing of the data received by either end of the connection.

					<h3>Select a Fish Dynamic Option Creation</h3>
					<p>
						This project, for my client-side programming course, focused on the dynamic creation of options following a user's selection.
						My favorite parts of this project are the bubble and fish animations and the graphics, which I created using Microsoft Powerpoint.
						This seems an unusual choice of program but the results were exactly as I wished the images to appear and there's a bit of a story behind my Powerpoint drawing skills.

					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>
						I'm a third year Information Technology and Human-Centered Computing student at the Rochester Institute of Technology.
						But if you've checked out my <a class = "outsideInfo" href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/cynthia-zachar-2112b2a2">LinkedIn profile</a> or my <a class = "outsideInfo" href = "https://www.dropbox.com/s/gbzdvw498o76qdu/Zachar_Cynthia_Resume_IT.docx?dl=0">resume</a>, you already know that.
						The purpose of this website is not to present the same information in a different format, but to give you a better idea of who I am and what kind of experience I have.

					<h3>Right now...</h3>
					<p>
						I am wrapping up a software engineering internship at UPMC Enterprises.
						I enjoyed the work and consider the internship a very rewarding experience and an ideal first co-op.
						For the upcoming Fall 2016 semester at RIT, I am enrolled in several psychology and human-centered computing related courses and am looking forward to putting in work toward my second major.

					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>
						I'm a third year Information Technology and Human-Centered Computing student at the Rochester Institute of Technology.
						But if you've checked out my <a class = "outsideInfo" href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/cynthia-zachar-2112b2a2">LinkedIn profile</a> or my <a class = "outsideInfo" href = "https://www.dropbox.com/s/8brp5liulby60gs/Zachar_Cynthia_Resume_IT.docx?dl=0">resume</a>, you already know that.
						The purpose of this website is not to present the same information in a different format, but to give you a better idea of who I am and what kind of experience I have.

					<h3>Right now...</h3>
					<p>
						I have begun taking classes for the fall 2016 semester at RIT.
						Outside of class, I am continuing to TA for an intro to Java class, am captaining the Women's Club Ultimate Frisbee team,
						and am acting as an ambassador for the Information Sciences and Technologies department and the Office of Career Services and Cooperative Education.
						I am beginning to think about and apply for internships for the summer of 2017.

					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>
						I'm a third year Information Technology and Human-Centered Computing student at the Rochester Institute of Technology.
						But if you've checked out my <a class = "outsideInfo" href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/cynthia-zachar-2112b2a2">LinkedIn profile</a> or my <a class = "outsideInfo" href = "https://www.dropbox.com/s/u170ozv3sqywgej/Zachar_Cynthia_Resume_IT.docx?dl=0">resume</a>, you already know that.
						The purpose of this website is not to present the same information in a different format, but to give you a better idea of who I am and what kind of experience I have.

					<h3>Right now...</h3>

						I'm heading into my spring semester of classes at RIT and am looking forward to working for Steelcase for the summer of 2017.

					<h3>An Unusual Skill: PowerPoint Illustration</h3>
					<p>
						The portrait of myself as well as all the animals you see here were created using the drawing tools of Microsoft PowerPoint.
						This seems an unusual choice of program, but when I was somewhere between the ages of 9 and 12, my sister and I created some elaborate PowerPoint slide shows as a means of entertaining ourselves.
						These slides featured animated stories using characters that we built using basic shapes and freehand and text that linked between slides.
						We built entire worlds for these characters -- likely inspired in part by Webkinz and Tamagotchi.
					</p>
					<p>
						It turns out that I retained some of my drawing skills and sharpened them further when I created fish illustrations for a client programming class project (see projects page).
						Now the drawings are almost entirely freehand and based off of images (rather than my imagination).
						The drawing on my home page is based on a different image than the one it transitions from, so that's why it's a little off.
						I do know how to use Adobe Illustrator fairly well but I keep coming back to PowerPoint when I know I can achieve the look I want with it.

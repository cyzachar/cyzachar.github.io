        <h2>Usability Test</h2>
        <div id = "tasks">
          <div class = "task">
            <p class = "taskStmt">Task #1:
              It’s the end of the year and both of your current captains are graduating.
              You want to remove the old captains from the team information and add two new ones then check to confirm that the updates were made successfully.
            </p>
            <h3>User #1: </h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Attempted to navigate to team page via My Account dropdown but that hotspot failed so she clicked on a team on the player dashboard</li>
              <li>Immediately clicked on the manage button then the roster one</li>
              <li>Tried clicking the pencil icon and got held up there for a while, expecting to edit captains on that page</li>
              <li>Eventually found the Team Info edit page and successfully removed the old captains and added new ones</li>
              <li>Selected the eye icon to preview changes</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class = "task">
            <p class = "taskStmt">Task #2:
              Now you want to see how your team from two years ago performed at sectionals.
              You’d also like to see the final scores for all the games.
            </p>
            <h3>User #1: </h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Navigated back to dashboard with a swift click on My Account</li>
              <li>Clicked on team archive and then an upcoming event to get to the calendar</li>
              <li>Backtracked to the dashboard then clicked on event archive and a particular event to view specific scores</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class = "task">
            <p class = "taskStmt">Task #3:
              It’s the beginning of a new season and you have several new rookies to roster for your team.
              Navigate to the roster page.
              What do you expect to happen/see when you click on the plus and edit options?
            </p>
            <h3>User #1: </h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Had already visited the roster page in a previous task so navigated there quickly</li>
              <li>Believed that the plus icon would add players to the roster or invite new players to confirm</li>
              <li>Thought the pencil icon would provide an option to change a player's position or #, remove players, and designate players as captains</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class = "task">
            <p class = "taskStmt">Task #4:
              View your upcoming schedule as a list.
              What do you think will happen when you click on the address of the event?
              What will happen when you click on the star or calendar icons?  Be as specific as possible.
              How about the icon to the right of the dropdown?
              What do you think it does and what options do you think would be provided?
            </p>
            <h3>User #1: </h3>
            <ul>
              <li>From main dashboard, clicked full schedule and switched to list view</li>
              <li>Expected clicking the event location to take her to an event details page with an embedded Google Map</li>
              <li>Expected stars to indicate favorites and considered the possibility of filtering by favorites</li>
              <li>Seemed uncertain about the calendar icon, thinking aloud that events would probably be added automatically to the website's calendar view and determined that clicking it may pull up a tab to add the event to your own personal Google Calendar</li>
              <li>Recognized the icon to the right of the dropdown from other websites but didn't know what it was for</li>
              <li>When told that it was for filtering, thought that it could provide options to filter by team, date, or state</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

          <h2>Additional Feedback</h2>
          <h3>User #1:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Brought up how extra clicking was needed in order to go back</li>
            <li>Instead of dropdown for list vs calendar view, switch to a button because there are only 2 options (e.g. "Switch to calendar view")</li>
            <li>Add labels to the icon buttons (e.g. edit/preview)</li>
            <li>Put option to add captain on the roster page as well</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

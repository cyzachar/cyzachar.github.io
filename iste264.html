        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          The USA Ultimate website faces the challenge of organizing a large quantity and variety of information for its website viewers in addition to keeping track of user, team, event, and community data and providing an interface that users will regularly interact with to stay engaged with a sport they love.
          While they do manage to juggle all of this and remain relatively on-top-of-things as the governing body for Ultimate Frisbee in the United States, their website implementation leaves much to be desired:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The design is unresponsive and the mobile version has drastically less content and functionality</li>
          <li>The design is uninviting and does not do much to encourage user engagement outside of using the website just long enough to accomplish what is absolutely necessary</li>
          <li>Content is largely geared toward current players with little effort devoted to sparking interest and bringing new players into the sport</li>
          <li>User experience seems to be a peripheral consideration as users are left to pick their way through the mass of information that the website dumps on them and to navigate an unattractive and un-streamlined dashboard and events listings to manage their teams and personal involvement in the sport</li>
          <li>The website does not do much to present a unified image of the Ultimate community at large.  The body appears to be splintered into many different local communities that do their own thing, rather removed from USAU and from each other.  Absent also is an emphasis on the organizationâ€™s role in international competition.</li>
        </ul>
				<h2>Project Scope</h2>
        <p>
          For course assignments, I will focus on redesigning the member dashboard and some of its features (e.g. team management, membership renewal) with the goal of improving user experience.
        </p>

				<h2>My Approach</h2>
        <p>
					As an Ultimate player myself, I know of several Ultimate players I can interview or ask for feedback on prototypes.
					As the main dashboard page would likely benefit most from iterating through many drafts (there's a lot of different ways I could lay it out), I plan on creating some low-fi prototypes for that.
					The pages that branch off of the main may also be good candidates for prototyping.
        </p>
